    <h1>About the Creepster Font</h1>

    <p><strong>Creepster</strong> is a display typeface designed by Sideshow and released through the Google Fonts library. It is part of a collection of fonts that are freely available for use on websites and in digital projects. The font is known for its spooky, horror-movie aesthetic, making it a popular choice for Halloween-themed designs, scary stories, or any context that requires a creepy, unsettling vibe.</p>

    <h2>Key Characteristics of Creepster</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Design Inspiration:</strong> Creepster’s design is inspired by vintage horror films, often evoking a sense of terror and unease. Its letterforms are jagged and uneven, giving it an eerie, disjointed appearance that mimics classic horror film title sequences.</li>
        <li><strong>Type Style:</strong> Creepster is classified as a display font, meaning it’s primarily used for large text elements such as headings, titles, or logos, where its unique style can stand out. It is less suited for body text due to its highly decorative nature.</li>
        <li><strong>Readability:</strong> Despite its quirky, uneven design, Creepster remains fairly legible at larger sizes, making it suitable for headings or short sentences. However, its exaggerated features make it difficult to use for smaller, dense blocks of text.</li>
        <li><strong>Font Formats:</strong> The font is available in popular web formats, including .woff2, .woff, and .ttf, ensuring it can be easily embedded on websites. Google Fonts provides these formats via a CDN, allowing easy integration into web projects.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Usage Scenarios</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Halloween & Horror Themes:</strong> Creepster is an ideal font for websites, event posters, or invitations related to Halloween or horror movies. Its bold and creepy appearance can immediately evoke the eerie atmosphere associated with these themes.</li>
        <li><strong>Pop Culture and Creative Projects:</strong> Due to its highly recognizable style, Creepster is often used in creative projects that need to capture attention with a bold, quirky font. It’s often seen in movie posters, haunted house advertisements, and even themed party invitations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Creepster Stands Out</h2>
    <p><strong>Unique and Uncommon:</strong> Creepster is not a system-installed font, meaning that most users won’t have it pre-installed on their computers. This makes it an excellent choice for your assignment, as serving the font from a server or Google Fonts ensures that it will be displayed correctly on any device.</p>

    <p><strong>Free and Open Source:</strong> Since Creepster is available through Google Fonts, it’s free to use and widely accessible. This makes it an appealing choice for web designers and developers looking for a high-impact font without licensing issues.</p>
